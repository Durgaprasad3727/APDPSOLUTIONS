Zoko Talent — Preview & Starter Package
======================================

Contents:
- index.html : interactive static mockup (open in browser)
- client/: sample React component stubs and firebase config templates
- server/: sample Node Express Razorpay server (create-order + webhook)
- functions/: sample Firebase Cloud Function webhook example
- firestore.rules : suggested Firestore security rules

How to use:
1. Download and unzip this package.
2. Open index.html in a browser to see the mockup preview.
3. For a working app, follow instructions in client/README.md to scaffold a React app and plug in Firebase keys.
4. To enable payments, deploy the server or Cloud Function and configure Razorpay credentials and webhook.

If you want, I can also create a full GitHub repo for this package and push the files there — you'll need to provide a connected GitHub account or I can give you instructions to create the repo locally and push.
